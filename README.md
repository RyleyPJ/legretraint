# Installation 

Drag n drop the folder into your resources and then put 'ensure/start legrestraint' and then restart your fivem server and use it!!

# NOTICE 

This has been tested but i havent tested it on another player, i was mainly checking for errors in the F8 console but there wasn't any that i saw so its untested on that part!!

If you have any issues please make a issue on this and i will fix/sort any problems you may have!
